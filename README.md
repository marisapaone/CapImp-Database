# CapImp-Database

The CapImp Database is tailored to building developers or owners of multiple buildings that
would like an organized record of their buildings, building equipment, and maintenance. This database
will store important information including building addresses, the number of apartments, the year in
which the buildings were constructed, and building drawings. The database will also store
information on pieces of equipment in the building, replacement schedules, and maintenance details
and dates. The individuals responsible for entering this information will be project managers of the
capital improvements division. I envision this database will be used by companies who own multiple
buildings in larger cities such as NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Miami, Austin, etc.

Additionally, the CapImp database will store the names of the building engineer, the property
manager, and the capital improvements project manager as well as the contact information for each
party. The database will also store the maintenance problems that arise with each building, the date that
the problem was discovered, the means and methods used  to remedy the problem, and the date the
service was performed on. To take the database a step further, it will also contain the contractors name
that serviced the problem, their contact information, and the length of time it took them to complete
the work, and electricity and gas usage.
